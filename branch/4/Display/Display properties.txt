1. display property: The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout. It specifies if/how an element is displayed.

2. a. display: block; - A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

		span {
				display: block;
			}


	b. display: inline; - An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline <span>/<a>/<img> element inside a paragraph.

	li {
    display: inline;
}

	<ul>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
	<ul>

	c. display: none; - It is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.
	
		h1.hidden {
			display: none;
		}
	
	d. visibility: hidden; - It also hides an element. However, the element will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout.
	
		h1.hidden {
			visibility: hidden;
		}

	e. display:inline-block; - inline-block elements are like inline elements but they can have a width and a height.
	
		.floating-box {
			display: inline-block;
			width: 150px;
			height: 75px;
			margin: 10px;
			border: 3px solid #73AD21;  
		}
